* 11 Mar:
  * If you are not familiar with github and how it works. Check this excellent video tutorial by Daniel Shiffman.

  * Here are few useful tips I found when using terminal git:
    * It's **cool** and let you **show off more** compared to using github desktop/web github.
    * If you are not sure about any command always use 'git <subcommand> help' for information.
    * Always start with 'git pull'.
    * To discard your uncommited changes and rollback to when you pull. Use 'git checkout .' **WARNING: Your work will lost after this command**.
